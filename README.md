German Terms of Service for a Diaspora pod
==========================================

Howdy. If you are German and you are running your own Diaspora-Pod, you might
be interested in this project. There are a lot of evil lawyers in Germany,
kicking people when they have no imprint and similar stuff.

So we decided to talk with some lawyers and write some easy-to-understand but
legally valid terms of service for your Diaspora pod. If you want to, use them,
they are licensed under the CC-BY license.

You have an idea? Submit a pull request and we merge it in! :-)
